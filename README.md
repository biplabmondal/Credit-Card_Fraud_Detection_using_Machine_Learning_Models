# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning Models

**Project Overview**

This project aims to tackle the growing issue of credit card fraud faced by Finex, a leading financial service provider based in Florida, US. With the surge in digital payment channels, fraudulent transactions have increased significantly, leading to revenue and profitability challenges for the organization. The goal of this project is to develop an efficient fraud detection system using machine learning techniques to identify and prevent unauthorized transactions effectively.

**Objectives**

* Fraud Detection: Leverage historical transaction data to identify fraudulent activities among customers and merchants.
* Risk Mitigation: Analyze the business repercussions of fraudulent transactions and propose strategies to minimize fraud risks effectively.
* Proactive Monitoring: Implement monitoring and prevention measures to reduce fraud.
* Operational Efficiency: Utilize machine learning to streamline processes, reduce manual reviews, mitigate chargeback costs, and minimize rejection of legitimate transactions.

**Steps to Solve the Problem**

1. Problem Identification

* Recognize the surge in credit card fraud and its impact on Finexâ€™s revenue and profitability.
* Understand the root causes of fraudulent transactions, including stolen/lost cards, data breaches, and ATM skimming.

2. Proposed Solution

* Develop a fraud detection model using machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent activities in real time.

3. Data Collection

* Gather a comprehensive dataset of credit card transactions, including:
    * Transaction amount
    * Timestamp
    * Merchant information
    * Other relevant features

4. Data Preprocessing

* Clean the dataset by:
    * Handling missing values
    * Removing duplicate records
* Perform feature engineering to extract valuable insights from the data.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyze the distribution of fraudulent transactions.
* Visualize transaction patterns to gain a deeper understanding of the data.
* Identify key features contributing to fraud detection.

6. Feature Selection

* Select the most relevant features to enhance the model's predictive performance.

7. Model Selection

* Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, including:
    * Logistic Regression
    * Decision Tree
    * Random Forest
    * XGBoost
8. Addressing Class Imbalance

* Handle the inherent imbalance in the dataset using:
    * SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
    * ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)

9. Hyperparameter Tuning and Final Model Selection

* Use GridSearchCV to fine-tune the hyperparameters.
* Select XGBoost (ADASYN) as the optimal model based on its performance.


**Key Features of the Solution**

1. Real-Time Fraud Detection: Identify fraudulent transactions as they occur.
2. Cost Savings: Reduce losses due to fraud and mitigate chargeback expenses.
3. Operational Efficiency: Streamline processes and minimize manual interventions.
4. Accuracy: Improve the detection rate while reducing false positives.


**Technologies Used**

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:
    * NumPy, Pandas (for data preprocessing)
    * Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
    * scikit-learn (for machine learning models and preprocessing)
    * imbalanced-learn (for handling class imbalance)
    * XGBoost (for high-performance modeling)

**Results**

After experimentation and model evaluation, the XGBoost (ADASYN) model was selected as the best-performing algorithm due to its high accuracy and ability to handle class imbalance effectively.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how machine learning can effectively detect credit card fraud, enabling financial institutions like Finex to mitigate risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance profitability.
